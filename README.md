# Biometric-Attendance
Built a Facial Recognition Model in Python.
Used Face Recognition library, to detect the face locations and its encoding in training dataset.
Compared faces with test dataset, using the face_distance, if the face_distance of the test and training dataset is more than threshold
value then the result is saved and stored along with time of input in the file.
